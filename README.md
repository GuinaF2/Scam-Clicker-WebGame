# [Scam Clicker]

## 📖 About the Project
This project is an incremental clicker game where the player performs simple actions—like clicking a button—to earn currency and purchase upgrades to generate income automatically.

It was developed for the second term of the Front-End Programming course, instructed by Professor José Carlos Domingues Flores.

## 🚀 Play Online
The game is live and fully accessible! You don't need to install anything to play.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
The main goal of this project was to apply fundamental concepts of modern front-end development in a practical application. The key objectives were:

* **State Management:** Learn to use React Hooks, especially `useState` and `useEffect`, to manage the application's state dynamically.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Practice creating and structuring reusable components in React.
* **TypeScript Integration:** Understand how to use TypeScript in a React project to ensure type safety and improve code quality.
* **Vite Tooling:** Get familiar with the Vite build tool, understanding its fast development server and build process.
* **Event Handling:** Implement user interactions, such as clicks and button events.

## 💡 Key Learnings
During the development, several key practical skills were acquired:

* **useEffect Deep Dive:** A deeper understanding of the `useEffect` dependency array and the importance of cleanup functions to avoid memory leaks, especially when using `setInterval`.
* **State Complexity:** Experience in managing multiple state variables and understanding how they interact and trigger re-renders.
* **TypeScript Benefits:** Practical appreciation for how TypeScript helps prevent common bugs (e.g., type mismatches) and makes refactoring safer.
* **Code Organization:** Improved practices in structuring project files and components for better readability and maintenance.

## ✨ Technologies Used

* **Vite:** A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development environment.
* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Local Development (Optional)

If you are a developer and wish to run the code locally or contribute, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

* **Node.js:** Vite requires Node.js to run. The latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version is recommended.
  To check if Node.js is installed, open your terminal and run:
  ```bash
  node -v
 
 NPM (Node Package Manager): NPM is installed automatically with Node.js. To check your NPM version, run:
```bash
npm -v
```
## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuinaF2/React-Typescript-Test-Site.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change your current directory to the newly cloned project folder.

```bash
cd React-Typescript-Test-Site
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

This command reads the package.json file and downloads all the necessary libraries and packages into the node_modules directory.

```bash
npm install
```
### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the Vite development server. This will compile the project and make it available on a local address with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enabled.

```bash 
npm run start
```
Once the command executes, your terminal will display a message similar to this:
```
Plaintext

  VITE v5.x.x  ready in 312 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```
### 5. View in Browser

Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided: http://localhost:5173

The application is now running locally. Any changes saved in the source code will be instantly reflected in the browser.

## 📜 Available Scripts
The package.json file includes the following script:

npm run start: Starts the application in development mode with HMR.
